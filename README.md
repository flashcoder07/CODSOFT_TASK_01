# Movie Recommendation
Movie Genre Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
I am excited to share my first project as an intern at CodSoft! In this project, I am developing a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.

Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a movie. This involves:

Preprocessing textual data (plot summaries)
Using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to transform the text data
Applying classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to build predictive models
Techniques and Tools
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).
Word Embeddings: Representations of text that capture the context of words in a dense vector space.
Classifiers:
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Logistic Regression: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning model used for classification and regression analysis.
Usage
Prepare your dataset with movie plot summaries and genres.
Preprocess the text data using the provided scripts.
Train the machine learning models using the training data.
Evaluate the models on the test data and compare their performance.
Progress and Updates
This project is a work in progress. I will be updating this repository regularly with my findings, code, and results. Stay tuned for more updates!
